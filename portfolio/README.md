[how to link - I'm not great at html](https://google.com)
<br/><br/>


Below are placeholders, just need them here so the formatting works
{:.note}


## example
* [install]{:.heading.flip-title} --- text
* [upgrade]{:.heading.flip-title} --- text
* [config]{:.heading.flip-title} --- I don't know what the following line in MD does
{:.related-posts.faded}

need to have links like this below. Test/examine how it works with html:
[install]: install.md
[upgrade]: upgrade.md
[config]: config.md
[basics]: basics.md
[writing]: writing.md
[scripts]: scripts.md
[build]: build.md
[advanced]: advanced.md
[LICENSE]: ../LICENSE.md
[NOTICE]: ../NOTICE.md
[CHANGELOG]: ../CHANGELOG.md
