    This project aimed to showcase basic HTML to give the user a better
    understanding of HTML and how the internet displays information for webpages.
    To help demonstrate these ideas, the goal of this day was to recreate the very
    basic personal website styles of some famous CS professors. For them,
    substance over style is key and in the right circumstances, it is hard to argue with.
