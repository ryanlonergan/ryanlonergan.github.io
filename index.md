  <strong>Hey there</strong>, my name is Ryan Lonergan, and I am an aspiring data scientist. I recently graduated with my Master of Science in Information Systems from the University of Washington and found my passion for the field.

  <br><br>

  If you asked me <strong>a few years ago</strong>, I would have never known that I would be fascinated about data. However, I found myself drawn to it over time as I observed how it could solve problems in novel ways, making life more convenient. From beginning with regressions in Excel to exploring machine learning models in Python, my interest in data science has only grown as I realized what it could accomplish.

  <br><br>

  <strong>Looking back</strong>, I come from a less traditional academic background. Highschool just was not for me and after I graduated, I worked blue-collar jobs. However, I was not satisfied with my work as it was not stimulating, and I became annoyed at all the little problems that I was not allowed to do much about. So, in 2013, I decided to enroll in college to pursue a career path I would find more fulfilling. 7 years and 3 degrees later, I am confident I have found that path through becoming data-driven and intend to further venture down it as I expand my knowledge, understanding and expertise of the field.

  <br><br>

  Through my work, I have gained <strong>skills and proficiency</strong> with machine learning and have aptitude with various supervised and unsupervised algorithms. I primarily code in Python, but am also highly familiar with other languages, like SQL or R, and specialized software, like Excel or Tableau. Beyond data science, I also have competency in a multitude of areas including cloud architecture, optimization, project management, statistics, and web development.

  <br><br>

  <strong>Further information</strong> about my skills and experiences can be found in my <a href="/resume/">resume</a> and examples of my work can be found in my <a href="/portfolio/">portfolio</a>.

  <br><br>

  In my <strong>spare time</strong>, I enjoy listening and playing music. I have played guitar off and on for 13 years and after a long break during college, I returned to playing much more frequently again. More recently, I have become interested in generative deep learning with AI for music generation. After being inspired by projects, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwtVkPKx3RA" target="_blank">Relentless Doppelganger <i>(Warning: loud)</i></a> by <a href="https://dadabots.com" target="_blank">DADABOTS</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/blog/jukebox/" target="_blank">Jukebox</a> by <a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank">OpenAI</a>, I am working on my own projects and am currently studying <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/generative-deep-learning/9781492041931/">Generative Deep Learning</a> to further my knowledge.
