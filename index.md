  I never knew I would be passionate about data. It took me some time to find my fascination with it and after a few college courses, I found myself drawn to it and how it can solve problems to make life more convenient. From beginning with regressions in Excel to exploring machine learning models in Python, my passion for data analytics has only grown over time as I was exposed to what it can accomplish. Through my studies, I have become data driven, which I aim to demonstrate through my work.

  I recently attained a Master of Science in Information Systems degree from the University of Washingtonâ€™s Michael G. Foster School of Business and am eager to apply my analytical skills.
