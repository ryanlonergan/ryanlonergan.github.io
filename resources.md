# Helpful Resources

* This unordered seed list will be replaced by the table of contents
{:toc}

This page will be contain learning resources that I found helpful for studying coding and data science. I only recommend items that I believe are useful and why I think so. Hopefully it helps others with their journey into data science.

*There are **no** affiliate links on this page. All links are directly to the sites  of the authors or publishers.*

This list is still a work in progress, so check back later for more info.

### Software
___

* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
	* Through Anaconda Navigator, managing programs and packages is simple through its GUI. For new coders, this intergace provides the simplest way to start without the need to make many changes during installation. It also provides simple updating and the option to choose specific versions of programs if needed.

* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
	* This is my preferred IDE for Python and where I spend the most time coding as it is ideal for data science and testing. One of my biggest gripes with the program is that it does not look the best and lacks some features, but extensions make it more customizable. I mostly use [Hinterland](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/hinterland/README.html) through [Nbextensions](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for its dropdown menu for autocomplete and [Juypter Themes](https://github.com/dunovank/jupyter-themes) for dark mode (Chesterish).

* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
	* Colab provides free access to cloud GPUs and allows users to execute code in cells directly in their browsers. While I still prefer using Juypter Notebook locally on my machine, it makes working on small teams easier and also provides an alternative environment when I am troubleshooting issues with packages or dependencies.

* [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)
	* Currently I prefer Spyder over [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) as it is more lightweight and requires less setup for environments. However, I mostly code Python in notebooks, so my preference may change over time.

* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/)
	* After using several different SQL RDBMS and platforms, I found these two the simplest to setup and maintain while also providing helpful language specific functions making them my preferred choices.

* [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)
	* Notion is a productivity app that allows individuals or teams to manage tasks or make notes. I mostly use it for keeping track of my work with different projects and to create lists of resources or items that I may need in the future.
